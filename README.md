# OpenBotClient
This project can be ran on a user computer to interact with the OpenBot robotic arm through a user interface. 
The client UI is currently fully functional, but has plans for aesthetic improvements in the future. The client
talks to the robotic arm over TCP/IP. The IP address of the raspberry pi must be updated within this project to 
be accurate and to successfully establish a socket with the robotic arm.
